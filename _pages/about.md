<p align="justify">
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research focuses on macroeconomics, informality, and tax policy. As a PhD student, I collaborated with the World Bank on economic analysis for Central America and the Caribbean. I was a Research Fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank before starting my PhD. I also served as the Economic Attaché at the Embassy of Honduras in Washington, DC, and as an Economic Analyst in the Technical Support Unit of the Ministry of the Presidency in Honduras. I hold a Master’s degree in Economics from Duke University and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras.
